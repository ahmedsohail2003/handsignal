          <h3>Research question</h3>
          <p>
            Can a standardized industrial hand-signal vocabulary serve as a
            reliable, learnable command channel for cobot cells, and what
            dwell time best trades false activations against responsiveness?
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Why crane signals</h3>
          <p>
            Signalperson hand signals (ASME B30.5) are a real, learned,
            safety-critical gesture language already used on industrial
            floors. That matters for three reasons: many operators arrive with
            pre-existing floor literacy in the vocabulary; gestures need no
            wake word and work at a distance; and they survive environments
            where hands are busy, gloves are on, and hearing protection makes
            voice unreliable.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Honest adaptation note</h3>
          <p>
            This prototype recognizes MediaPipe&apos;s canonical single-hand
            static poses, which constrains the vocabulary. Only the open-palm
            STOP closely matches its crane counterpart. The other four
            mappings are adaptations of the crane vocabulary&apos;s semantics
            to camera-recognizable poses, and they are labeled as adaptations
            in the legend: closed fist held 1.5 s adapts &quot;dog
            everything&quot; to an emergency stop; index-up adapts the
            &quot;move slowly&quot; modifier; thumb-up and the V sign have no
            B30.5 equivalent. A production system would train recognizers on
            the actual dynamic B30.5 signals.
          </p>

          <h3>Interaction safeguards</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Debounce (120 ms) filters classifier flicker before a gesture is
              treated as a candidate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dwell-time arming (default 600 ms, adjustable 300–1200 ms) shows
              a filling ring, so a command is a deliberate hold, never a
              passing pose. The dwell slider exists precisely because the
              study&apos;s core question is where this parameter should sit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Emergency stop requires a longer 1.5 s hold: a false e-stop
              halts production, so it must cost more intent.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a command fires, the same gesture cannot fire again until
              it has been released and its refractory period has elapsed —
              no machine-gun re-fires — while a different gesture (for
              example STOP) can always interrupt immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              E-stop recovery is deliberately not gesture-driven: an
              on-screen two-step reset returns the cell only to IDLE.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is simulated</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The cobot cell is a 2D kinematic cartoon (keyframed Cartesian
              path with 2-link inverse kinematics), not a physical or
              physics-simulated robot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simulated-input mode injects synthetic gesture classifications
              from keys 1–5 with an adjustable synthetic confidence. It is
              labeled in the UI, and every downstream stage — state machine,
              cell commands, logging — is identical for real and simulated
              input.
            </li>
            <li>
              Camera mode, where available, runs MediaPipe&apos;s
              GestureRecognizer with the official hosted model. No gesture
              data leaves the browser.
            </li>
          </ul>
